## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Current Security Implementations

#### 1. **Authentication & Authorization**

- ✅ JWT token-based authentication
- ✅ Secure token storage using platform-specific secure storage
- ✅ Automatic token refresh
- ✅ Session timeout management
- ✅ Biometric authentication support (iOS/macOS)

```dart
// Token storage example
import 'package:flutter_secure_storage/flutter_secure_storage';

final storage = FlutterSecureStorage();
await storage.write(key: 'jwt_token', value: token);
```

#### 2. **Data Security**

- ✅ HTTPS-only communication
- ✅ SSL certificate pinning (planned)
- ✅ Encrypted local storage for sensitive data
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

#### 3. **API Security**

- ✅ API timeout configuration
- ✅ Request/response interceptors
- ✅ Error handling without exposing internals
- ✅ Rate limiting (backend-side)

```dart
// Secure API configuration
class ApiConfig {
  static const int requestTimeout = 15;
  static Map<String, String> authHeaders(String token) => {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer $token',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  };
}
```

#### 4. **Environment Configuration**

- ✅ Environment variables for configuration
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets
- ✅ `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Separate configs for dev/prod

#### 5. **Code Security**

- ✅ No sensitive data in code
- ✅ Obfuscation for release builds
- ✅ ProGuard/R8 enabled (Android)
- ✅ Code signing (iOS/Android)

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Protecting Your Account

- 🔒 Use strong, unique passwords
- 🔑 Enable biometric authentication if available
- 📱 Keep the app updated
- 🚫 Don't share your credentials
- ⚠️ Be cautious of phishing attempts
- 🔄 Regularly review your account activity

#### Device Security

- 🔒 Use device lock screen (PIN/Pattern/Biometric)
- 🔄 Keep your OS updated
- 🚫 Don't root/jailbreak your device
- 📱 Install apps only from official stores
- 🔍 Review app permissions

### For Developers

#### Development Practices

```bash
# ✅ DO: Use environment variables
LOCAL_NETWORK_IP=192.168.1.100
API_KEY=get_from_secure_vault

# ❌ DON'T: Hardcode sensitive data
final apiKey = "sk_live_12345abcdef"; // NEVER DO THIS!
```

#### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] No API keys or secrets in code
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't expose internals
- [ ] HTTPS used for all API calls
- [ ] Proper authentication checks
- [ ] Secure data storage used
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security tests pass

#### Secure Coding Examples

**✅ Good: Secure password handling**
```dart
Future<void> login(String email, String password) async {
  try {
    final response = await authService.login(email, password);
    await secureStorage.write(key: 'token', value: response.token);
    // Password is not stored or logged
  } catch (e) {
    // Generic error message, no sensitive details
    throw AuthException('Authentication failed');
  }
}
```

**❌ Bad: Insecure password handling**
```dart
Future<void> login(String email, String password) async {
  print('Password: $password'); // DON'T LOG PASSWORDS!
  prefs.setString('password', password); // DON'T STORE PASSWORDS!
  
  try {
    final response = await authService.login(email, password);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error: $e'); // Might expose sensitive details
  }
}
```

## 🤖 Automated Security

### GitHub Actions Workflows

We run automated security scans on every push and pull request:

#### 1. **Security Vulnerability Scan** (`security-scan.yml`)

- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- Secret detection in code
- Android security linting

**Runs:** Push to main/develop, PRs, Weekly schedule

#### 2. **Credentials Check** (`credentials-check.yml`)

- Detects exposed `.env` files
- Finds hardcoded IPs
- Identifies API key patterns
- Checks for Android keystores
- Validates Firebase configs

**Runs:** Push to main/develop, PRs

### Manual Security Audit

```bash
# Run security checks locally
flutter analyze
flutter test --coverage

# Check for outdated/vulnerable packages
flutter pub outdated
```

### Dependency Management

We regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Check for security updates
flutter pub outdated --mode=null-safety

# Update dependencies
flutter pub upgrade

# Verify app still works
flutter test
flutter run
```
